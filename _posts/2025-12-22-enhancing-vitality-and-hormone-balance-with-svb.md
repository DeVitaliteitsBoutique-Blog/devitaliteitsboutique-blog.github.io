Feeling tired, moody, or out of balance? You’re not alone. Many women across The Netherlands experience symptoms like fatigue, mood swings, insomnia, and irregular cycles, often without realizing that vitality and sleep are at the heart of hormone health. As a sleepcoach and holistic hormone coach, De Vitaliteitsboutique (svb) empowers women to restore their energy and achieve true hormonal balance through practical, caring support.

## Why Vitality and Sleep Matter for Hormone Balance

Vitality isn’t just about having enough energy to get through the day. It’s a sign that your body is in balance—your hormones are communicating, your stress is manageable, and your mind feels clear. However, when sleep is disrupted—whether you’re struggling with falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up unrefreshed—your hormones can easily get out of sync.

As a sleeptherapist at svb knows, poor sleep can affect your entire hormone system. It can:

- Increase levels of stress hormones like cortisol, making you feel anxious or irritable  
- Disrupt the balance of estrogen and progesterone, leading to PMS, menopause symptoms, or irregular cycles  
- Lower growth hormone and DHEA, which are crucial for repair, resilience, and mood  

That’s why addressing sleeping problems is one of the most powerful ways to support vitality and hormone health.

## Stress and Hormones—A Two-Way Street

Stress is not just a feeling—it’s a physical and mental response that directly impacts your hormones. Everyday factors such as poor sleep, processed foods, or even long workdays can increase stress on your body. Over time, this can lead to:

- Fatigue and burnout  
- Mood swings and irritability  
- Hormone problems such as PMS, hot flashes, or irregular cycles  

But here’s the good news: Stress isn’t always the enemy. At De Vitaliteitsboutique, we encourage a positive stress mindset. By viewing challenges as opportunities for growth, you can actually boost beneficial hormones like DHEA and growth hormone. This mindset shift helps your body build resilience instead of becoming overwhelmed.
