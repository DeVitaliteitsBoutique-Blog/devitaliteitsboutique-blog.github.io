Every September, Prinsjesdag 2025 op tv invites Dutch women to reflect on the future and invest in their own well-being. It’s the perfect moment to shine a light on vitality, sleep, and hormonal balance—three pillars that directly influence how women feel, work, and live.

## Why Sleep and Vitality Matter for Women in The Netherlands

For many women in The Netherlands, juggling work, family, and personal goals can lead to fatigue, mood swings, and irregular cycles. These symptoms are often the result of hormone imbalances. As a *sleepcoach*, *sleeptherapist*, and *hormone expert* based in The Netherlands, De Vitaliteitsboutique understands that restoring balance begins with two essentials: quality sleep and true vitality.

### The Power of a Good Night’s Sleep for Hormone Balance

Sleep is not just about rest—it’s the foundation for hormone health. When you sleep well, your body produces growth hormone and DHEA, two key hormones that repair tissues, boost immunity, and help regulate your menstrual cycle. Insomnia or poor sleep can disrupt these hormones, leading to increased stress, PMS symptoms, and even menopause complaints.

Our approach as a *holistic hormone coach* and *sleepcoach* in The Netherlands focuses on practical steps women can take to improve their sleep:

- Creating calming evening routines  
- Managing screen time and light exposure  
- Supporting natural melatonin production  
- Addressing underlying issues like stress or hormone problems

## Stress: A Signal, Not an Enemy for Women’s Health

Stress is a normal part of life, but it becomes harmful when it persists. Unlike what many think, stress isn’t just a mental reaction—it’s also a physical response, influenced by factors like processed foods, lack of movement, and, most importantly, poor sleep.

Women often experience stress-related symptoms such as anxiety, fatigue, and even hormonal imbalances. But here’s the good news: by shifting your perspective to a positive stress mindset, you can teach your body to respond differently. Seeing challenges as opportunities for growth can actually stimulate beneficial hormones, like DHEA and growth hormone, supporting resilience and vitality.
