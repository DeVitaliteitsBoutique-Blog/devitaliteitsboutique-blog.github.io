A new rookverbod (smoking ban) is a positive step for public health in The Netherlands, but its benefits go beyond cleaner air—they remind us of the importance of making healthy choices every day. For women, especially female entrepreneurs and those balancing busy lives, these choices can profoundly impact vitality, sleep, and hormonal balance.

## The Hidden Link Between Vitality, Sleep, and Hormones

Many women experience hormonal imbalances at some point, leading to symptoms like fatigue, mood swings, irregular periods, or even insomnia. These symptoms are not just a nuisance—they can affect confidence, productivity, and overall joy. As a sleepcoach and holistic hormone coach, we see how foundational good sleep and vitality are for managing these challenges.

When sleep is disrupted—whether by stress, irregular routines, or stimulants—your body’s delicate hormonal balance is thrown off. Hormones like cortisol (the stress hormone) and melatonin (the sleep hormone) start to work against each other, making it harder to rest deeply or feel energetic during the day. This can create a cycle where poor sleep leads to more stress, and more stress leads to even worse sleep.

## Why Stress Isn’t the Enemy

Stress often gets a bad name, but it’s simply your body’s response to a challenge—physical or mental. Factors like processed foods, late-night screen time, and even skipping meals can increase stress levels, putting extra pressure on hormone regulation. But here’s the good news: when managed well, stress can actually help you grow stronger.

By cultivating a positive mindset toward stress, you can encourage your body to produce beneficial hormones like DHEA and growth hormone. These support resilience, energy, and even immune system strength. Instead of seeing stress as something to fear, try viewing it as a signal—an opportunity to listen to your body’s needs and make supportive choices.
