Do you ever dream of waking up on a peaceful island, feeling truly rested and full of energy? For many women, especially entrepreneurs juggling busy lives in The Netherlands, that level of vitality can seem far away. But just like the tranquil rhythms of la gomera, you can create a sense of inner balance—starting with your sleep and hormonal health.

## Why Vitality Starts With Sleep

As a sleepcoach and sleeptherapist, we see it every day: sleep is the foundation of vitality and hormone balance. Hormones like melatonin, cortisol, and growth hormone are deeply influenced by how well you rest. Poor sleep or insomnia can quickly lead to fatigue, mood swings, and even irregular cycles—symptoms that are all too common in women managing PMS, menopause, or other hormone problems.

When sleep is disrupted, your body struggles to keep hormone levels stable. This can affect everything from concentration to emotional resilience. The good news? Prioritizing restful sleep is a powerful step toward regaining control over your energy, mood, and overall health.

## Understanding Stress As Both Challenge And Opportunity

Stress is not just a mental feeling—it's a physical response shaped by your lifestyle. As a stress therapist and stress coach, we know that factors like processed foods, lack of movement, and especially poor sleep can increase stress hormones such as cortisol. Over time, this can worsen hormonal imbalances and leave you feeling drained or overwhelmed.

But stress can also be a force for growth. By adopting a positive stress mindset, you can encourage your body to produce beneficial hormones like DHEA and growth hormone, which support healing, energy, and resilience. Learning to see challenges as opportunities—rather than threats—can help you build inner strength and balance.
