Are you dreaming of running the Marathon New York 2025, or simply want to feel more vibrant every day? For many women, the journey to greater vitality and resilience starts with understanding the powerful connection between sleep, hormones, and stress. Whether you’re a dedicated runner, a busy entrepreneur, or striving for better work-life balance, prioritizing your holistic health can transform not only your marathon training but your entire life.

## How Sleep and Hormones Influence Your Vitality

Sleep is the foundation of vitality, especially for women managing hormonal changes due to PMS, menopause, or everyday stress. As a sleepcoach and holistic hormone coach, we see firsthand how sleeping problems and hormone imbalances can lead to symptoms like:

- Fatigue  
- Mood swings  
- Irregular cycles  
- Difficulty concentrating  
- Low motivation

Poor sleep disrupts the delicate balance of hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, and cortisol. This can intensify PMS and menopause symptoms, trigger insomnia, and undermine your immune system strength—making it harder to reach your personal or athletic goals.

## Stress Is More Than a Feeling

Stress isn’t just mental—it’s a whole-body response. Factors like processed foods, lack of sleep, and even pushing yourself too hard in training can raise stress hormone levels. Over time, this may lead to burnout, digestive complaints, and more pronounced hormone problems.

But here’s the good news: stress can also be a positive force. By shifting your mindset and viewing challenges (like preparing for the Marathon New York 2025) as opportunities to grow, you actually boost helpful hormones such as DHEA and growth hormone. These support recovery, energy, and resilience.
